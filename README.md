# Weather-forecasting-using-time-series-data

**Problem Definition:**
The project involves analyzing a time-series dataset containing daily weather measurements in Delhi from 2013 to 2017. The primary goal is to explore and visualize the dataset's characteristics, prepare the data for multivariate time series analysis, and develop a deep learning model to forecast the mean daily temperature ("meantemp") two weeks into the future.

The objective is to provide accurate temperature forecasts for better planning and decision-making.

**Proposed approaches:**
- To address the business problem, a recurrent neural network (RNN) technique was employed. Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were explored.

- Several experiments were conducted to identify the best-performing model configuration. These experiments involved different combinations of LSTM and GRU architectures with varying numbers of layers (units) and sequence lengths (n_steps). The goal was to find the model that yielded the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across different forecasting horizons.

**Major Findings and Recommendations:**

Model architecture of LSTM, units = 150 layers, n-steps = 30 and mode architecture of GRU, units = 150 layers, n-steps = 30 achieved the lowest average MAE across forecasting horizons, both at 3.16. These models tied for the best performance in terms of accuracy.

Recommendations to Improve Model Performance:

1. More Data: Acquire additional historical data to increase the model's training dataset. Deep learning models often benefit from larger datasets, and having more historical weather data can help capture complex patterns.

2. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to obtain better estimates of mean temperature predictions and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. This approach can provide more robust results compared to a simple holdout method.

3. Feature Selection: Evaluate the importance of different input features and consider removing less relevant ones to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting. Additionally, consider incorporating other relevant meteorological variables, such as cloudiness and precipitation, to enhance the model's inputs and potentially improve forecasting accuracy.

4. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, particularly if the model performs well on the training data but poorly on validation or test data. Regularization can help maintain model generalization.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Continue experimenting with different hyperparameters for the chosen architecture. Explore various combinations of units, layers, and sequence lengths (n_steps) to identify configurations that further improve forecasting accuracy.

In conclusion, achieving accurate temperature forecasts in a multivariate time series analysis is a complex task that can benefit from both data-related and model-related enhancements. By incorporating these recommendations and refining the deep learning model, it is possible to enhance the accuracy and reliability of temperature predictions, which can have valuable applications in weather forecasting and planning.
